# AD7616 ADC Driver (C-based)

This repository contains a C-based driver library for the **Analog Devices AD7616 16-bit, 8/16-channel Analog-to-Digital Converter**. This library is designed to provide a robust and easy-to-use interface for controlling the AD7616 and acquiring high-resolution analog data in your microcontroller projects.

---

## Overview

The AD7616 is a high-performance, 16-bit, 8-channel (or 16-channel in multiplexed mode) ADC with a fast throughput rate, often communicating via a parallel or serial (SPI) interface. This driver focuses on abstracting the low-level communication and configuration of the AD7616, allowing developers to quickly integrate it into their embedded systems for precision analog measurements. It provides functions to configure channels, trigger conversions, and read converted data.

---

## Features

* **16-bit ADC resolution** support.
* Handles **multi-channel conversions** (8 or 16 channels, depending on configuration).
* **SPI communication interface** for data transfer and control.
* Functions for **channel selection** and **conversion triggering**.
* **Reading converted data** from specified channels.
* Designed as a **generic C library**, facilitating portability across various microcontroller platforms with a proper SPI and GPIO abstraction layer.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To utilize this driver library, you will need:

* A C-compatible development environment (e.g., STM32CubeIDE, PlatformIO, VS Code with appropriate toolchains, or simply GCC/Clang for a specific MCU).
* A microcontroller development board with **SPI hardware capabilities** and sufficient GPIOs (e.g., STM32, ESP32, AVR, PIC).
* An **Analog Devices AD7616** ADC module or IC.
* A fundamental understanding of **C programming** and **embedded systems**, particularly SPI communication.

### Hardware Connections

Connect your AD7616 to your microcontroller's SPI bus and required control pins. The AD7616 typically uses a 4-wire SPI interface, plus additional control pins:

* **SDO (Serial Data Out):** Connects to your MCU's MISO (Master In, Slave Out) pin.
* **SDI (Serial Data In):** Connects to your MCU's MOSI (Master Out, Slave In) pin.
* **SCLK (Serial Clock):** Connects to your MCU's SCK (Serial Clock) pin.
* **CS (Chip Select/Chip Enable):** Connects to an MCU GPIO output pin.
* **CONVST (Convert Start):** Connects to an MCU GPIO output pin (to trigger conversions).
* **RESET (Reset):** Connects to an MCU GPIO output pin (or pull-up/down if not used).
* **RANGE, PAR/SER, OS (Oversampling)**: These are configuration pins that might be controlled by GPIOs or hardwired depending on your application.

Ensure proper power supply (VCC, GND) and analog input connections (AIN0-AIN7 or AIN0-AIN15) to the AD7616.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aldrinrebellow7/AD7616-ADC-driver-C-based-.git](https://github.com/aldrinrebellow7/AD7616-ADC-driver-C-based-.git)
    ```
2.  **Integrate into your Project:**
    * Copy the library's source files (`AD7616.c` and `AD7616.h`) into your microcontroller project's source directories.
    * Configure your project's build system (Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, or IDE settings) to compile `AD7616.c` and include the path to `AD7616.h`.
    * Include the main header file in your application code:
        ```c
        #include "AD7616.h"
        ```
    * **Crucially:** You will also need to provide implementations for the **SPI and GPIO abstraction layer functions** (as discussed in the "Porting" section below) for your specific microcontroller.

### Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to initialize the AD7616, configure a channel, trigger a conversion, and read the 16-bit result. This assumes your microcontroller's SPI peripheral and necessary GPIOs are already initialized.

```c
// Example: Acquire data from AD7616 Channel 0

#include "AD7616.h"
#include "spi_gpio_port.h" // Include your custom SPI/GPIO porting layer header

// Define AD7616 control pins based on your MCU's GPIO setup
// Replace with your actual port and pin definitions.
#define AD7616_CS_PORT          GPIOC
#define AD7616_CS_PIN           GPIO_PIN_0

#define AD7616_CONVST_PORT      GPIOC
#define AD7616_CONVST_PIN       GPIO_PIN_1

#define AD7616_RESET_PORT       GPIOC
#define AD7616_RESET_PIN        GPIO_PIN_2 // Or hardwire to VCC if not used

// Assuming your SPI peripheral handle is 'hspi1' (for STM32 example)
// You might pass this handle in the AD7616_Init function or use a global.
// (For generic C, the porting layer handles the SPI peripheral directly)

int main(void)
{
    // 1. Initialize your microcontroller's SPI peripheral and required GPIOs.
    // This part is specific to your MCU (e.g., MX_SPI1_Init() and MX_GPIO_Init() for STM32,
    // or specific ESP-IDF/AVR calls).
    SPI_GPIO_PORT_Init(); // This is a placeholder for your actual MCU init.

    // 2. Initialize the AD7616 driver.
    // Pass the chip select and convert start pin details.
    AD7616_Init(AD7616_CS_PORT, AD7616_CS_PIN, AD7616_CONVST_PORT, AD7616_CONVST_PIN);

    // If you have a RESET pin, you might call a reset function here:
    // AD7616_Reset(AD7616_RESET_PORT, AD7616_RESET_PIN);

    // You might also need to set RANGE, PAR/SER, OS pins if controlled by GPIOs.
    // AD7616_ConfigureMode(...); // Placeholder for a mode configuration function

    uint16_t adc_value_ch0;

    while (1)
    {
        // Select the desired analog input channel (e.g., Channel 0)
        // The AD7616 often supports channel selection via command or direct control.
        // If your library has a function like this:
        AD7616_SelectChannel(0); // Select analog input channel 0

        // Trigger a conversion.
        // This usually involves pulling CONVST low then high.
        AD7616_StartConversion();

        // Wait for conversion to complete (check busy pin or use a delay).
        // If your library provides a wait function:
        // AD7616_WaitForConversion();
        // Or a simple delay (less precise):
        SPI_GPIO_PORT_Delay_ms(1); // Small delay to allow conversion

        // Read the converted 16-bit data from the AD7616
        adc_value_ch0 = AD7616_ReadData();

        // Now, 'adc_value_ch0' holds the 16-bit digital value from Channel 0.
        // You can process this value, convert it to voltage, etc.
        // For example: float voltage = (float)adc_value_ch0 * (VREF / 65536.0f);

        // Delay before the next conversion
        SPI_GPIO_PORT_Delay_ms(100);
    }
}
